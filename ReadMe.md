### CI/CD using GitHub Actions

This GitHub Actions workflow (on main branch):
 - sets up an environment with JDK 11, 
 - builds a Java application using Gradle, 
 - creates a JAR file, 
 - uploads it as an artifact, 
 - retrieves the latest Docker image version from the private GitHub Container Registry, 
 - increments the version based on a VARIABLE on GITHUB, 
 - then builds and pushes a Docker image to the private GitHub Container Registry.

 ### Preconditions
- define DOCKER_PAT as a secret to access GitHub Container Registry
- define SEM_VER_INCREMENT as a variable with setting one of the value (MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH)
